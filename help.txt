## Hello everyone!!!
Welcome to GSauce's Music player

For the time being it can only play .mp3 files
Will update other formats in the newer version

### Few Short-Cuts that will be useful.

A            --> To add songs to the player
S            --> STOP
F            --> Show favourites
P            --> PLAY
SPACEABR     --> PAUSE
RIGHT ARROW  --> Next Song
LEFT ARROW   --> Previous Song
Crtl + S     --> Save song list    

Drawbacks of this music player are
  
  . You can only play MP3 formats
  . Your songs should be in the following path
        D:/songs/
